# Cat Facts Node JS Project

Let's learn more about some of the animals in the cat
family!

I created this project to demonstrate my unit testing
skills. In this case, I used Jest, which is a JavaScript
testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any
JavaScript codebase.

There are three functions which are tested in this project.
All of them can be found in the file: 'src/cat-facts.js'.
This isn't quite the robust project. Regardless, I set up
the file structure to make it easier to add on more
functions and files.

### Functions

Again, each function is inside the 'cat-facts.js' file
located in the 'src' folder. THe functions include:

1. `getLargestCat()`
2. `getCatInfo()`
3. `getCatsCanLiveToAge()`

## Project setup

Complete the steps below to get the project to run.

### Getting started

1. Clone this repository in your local machine.

2. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory on your
   command line. Then, run the following command:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

    This will install the libraries needed to run the tests.

### Tests

To run the tests, you can run the following command from the
command line. Note: you will need to be in the root
directory of your local directory.

```
npm test
```

### Test watcher

If you'd like to make changes to the project, you can have
the tests run constantly. This means that each time you save
your file, your tests will be re-run. To do so, you can run
the following:

```
npm run watch
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to exit out of the constant
runner.
