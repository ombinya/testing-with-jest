# Cat Facts Node JS Project

Let's learn more about some of the animals in the cat
family, except your domestic cat!

I created this project to demonstrate my unit testing
skills. In this case, I used Jest, which is is a JavaScript
testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any
JavaScript codebase.

There are three functions which are tested in this project.
All of them can be found in the file: 'src/cat-facts.js'.
This isn't quite the robust project. Regardless, I set up
the file structure to make it easier for to add on more
functions and files.

### Functions

Each function is inside the cat-facts.js file located in the
`src/` folder.

1. `getLargestCat()`
2. `getCatInfo()`
3. `getCatsCanLiveToAge()`

## Project setup

Complete the steps below to get the project to run.

### Getting started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

2. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory on your
   command line. Then, run the following command:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

    This will install the libraries needed to run the tests.

3. Open up the repository in VSCode (or 'cd' to the
   repository on the terminal).

### Tests

To run the tests, you can run the following command from the
command line. Note: you will need to be in the root
directory of your local directory.

```
npm test
```

### Test watcher

If you'd like to make changes to the project, you can have
the tests run constantly. This means that each time you save
your file, your tests will be re-run. To do so, you can run
the following:

```
npm run watch
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to exit out of the constant
runner.

### Run file

If you want to manually test out your file, you can do so by
running the following command.

```
node index.js
```

The output will be printed to your terminal.
